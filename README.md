# Data Cleaning CLI

## Description

This repository contains some example code for creating data cleaning pipelines using the Rich Library in Python.

Some principles for creating a CLI for data cleaning:

- Try to use the formatting to make the CLI as readable as possible
- Include a count of how many items you have left to clean
- Write the output to a file as you are cleaning
